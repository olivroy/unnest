Description: Fast conversion of hierarchical data structures (e.g. jsons, xml
             etc) into data.frames. Unnesting is performed according to a spec
             which allows for both flattening and stacking of the nested
             levels. The entire algorithm performs a single copy of the original
             nested structures into the final output.
